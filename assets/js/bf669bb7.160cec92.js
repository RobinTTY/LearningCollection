This is a form of client\u2013server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request\u2013response message-passing system.\nThe RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures is largely the same whether it is local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.\nRPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept."}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"when-to-use-rpc-vs-rest-from-stackoverflow",children:"When to use RPC vs REST (from StackOverflow)"}),"\n",(0,r.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When done correctly, REST improves long-term evolvability and scalability at the cost of performance and added complexity.

RPC services are ideal for circumstances where client and server are tightly coupled and follow the same development cycle.\nHowever, most so-called REST services don't really follow REST at all, because REST became just a buzzword for any kind of HTTP API.
