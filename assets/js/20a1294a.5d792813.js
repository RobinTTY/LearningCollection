In this way, you can change the implementation of the IService interface at any time (and for how many times you want) without changing the client class code.']}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(n.p,{children:"Easy Explanation:\nDependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself.
