Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where you need to. Here’s an example:

```gql
{
  leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
  rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
}

fragment comparisonFields on Character {
  name
  appearsIn
  friends {
    name
  }
}
```

## Using variables inside fragments

It is possible for fragments to access variables declared in the query or mutation:

```gql
query HeroComparison($first: Int = 3) {
  leftComparison: hero(episode: EMPIRE) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
  rightComparison: hero(episode: JEDI) {
    ...comparisonFields
  }
}
​
fragment comparisonFields on Character {
  name
  friendsConnection(first: $first) {
    totalCount
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
