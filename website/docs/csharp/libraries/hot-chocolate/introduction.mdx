## GraphQL operations

With a REST API we have certain operations we can do like GET, PUT, POST, etc. requests. In GraphQL there are also operation types, those are:

- [Queries](queries)
- [Mutations](mutations)
- [Subscriptions](subscriptions)

An operation has the following structure:

![operation-structure](/img/docs/csharp/libraries/hot-chocolate/operation-structure2.png)

- **Operation keyword:** Which operation we want to execute
- **Operation name:** A name we give to our operation (doesn't have to be unique)
- **Variables:** We can pass in variables to our operations
- **Selection Sets:** A selection set defines an ordered set of selections (the data we want to query for instance)
  - **Field:** GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects
  - **Root Field Selection:** Field on the Root Selection Set are called Root Field Selection
