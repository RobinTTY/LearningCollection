title: Inserting Data
---

The key methods for adding/inserting entities via the DbContext are `Add` and `AddRange`.

![inserting-data](/img/docs/csharp/efcore/inserting-data.png)

When an entry is added like this:

```csharp
var author = new Author{ FirstName = "William", LastName = "Shakespeare" };
context.Add<Author>(author);
context.SaveChanges();
```

The `Author.Id` will automatically be updated with the id generated by the db.

## Batch Inserting

We can also add multiple entities at once using `AddRange`:

```csharp
context.Authors.AddRange(
  new Author{ FirstName = "William", LastName = "Shakespeare" },
  new Author{ FirstName = "Sofia", LastName = "Segovia" },
  new Author{ FirstName = "Hugh", LastName = "Howey" },
)
context.SaveChanges();
```

Performance wise this doesn't change anything from calling `Add` multiple times as long as we only call `SaveChanges` once at the end. For high performance inserts [EFCore.BulkExtensions](https://github.com/borisdj/EFCore.BulkExtensions) is currently the way to go.
