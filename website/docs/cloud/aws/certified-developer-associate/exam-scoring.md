## Tips

- Most questions are going to be scenario based
- For all the questions, rule out answers that you know for sure are wrong
- For the remaining answers, understand which one makes the most sense
- There are very few trick questions
- Don’t over-think it
- If a solution seems feasible but highly complicated, it’s probably wrong
- Read each service’s FAQ (e.g. [https://aws.amazon.com/de/lambda/faqs/](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lambda/faqs/)), they cover a lot of the questions asked at the exam
