## AWS Regions

If you need to launch a new application which Region should you chose?

Depends on:

- Compliance with data governance/legal requirements
- Proximity (latency)
- Available services
- Pricing

### Availability Zones (AZ)

- Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, max is 6)
  - e.g. ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2c
  - Each AZ is one or more discrete data center which are separate from each other

### AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)

- Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence
- Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
