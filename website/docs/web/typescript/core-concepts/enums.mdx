Enums are one of the few features TypeScript has which is **not a type-level extension** of JavaScript.
Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

## Numeric enums

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}
```

Above, we have a numeric enum where `Up` is initialized with `1`. All of the following members are auto-incremented from that point on. By default enums start numbering their members starting at `0`.

## String enums

In a string enum, each member has to be constant-initialized with a string literal, or with another string enum member:

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}
```

## Downsides of Enums

There is some discussion about whether you should ever use enums in the first place, because they have some weird runtime behavior.
