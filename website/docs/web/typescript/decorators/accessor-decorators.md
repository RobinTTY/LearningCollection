An Accessor Decorator is declared just before an accessor declaration. The accessor decorator is applied to the Property Descriptor for the accessor and can be used to observe, modify, or replace an accessorâ€™s definitions. An accessor decorator cannot be used in a declaration file, or in any other ambient context (such as in a `declare` class).

The expression for the accessor decorator will be called as a function at runtime, with the following three arguments:

1. Either the constructor function of the class for a static member, or the prototype of the class for an instance member
2. The name of the member
3. The Property Descriptor for the member

If the accessor decorator returns a value, it will be used as the Property Descriptor for the member.

The following is an example of an accessor decorator (`@configurable`) applied to a member of the Point class:

```ts
class Point {
  private _x: number;
  private _y: number;
  constructor(x: number, y: number) {
    this._x = x;
    this._y = y;
  }

  @configurable(false)
  get x() {
    return this._x;
  }

  @configurable(false)
  get y() {
    return this._y;
  }
}
```

We can define the `@configurable` decorator using the following function declaration:

```ts
function configurable(value: boolean) {
  return function (
    target: any,
    propertyKey: string,
    descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
  ) {
    descriptor.configurable = value;
  };
}
```
