Arithmetic operators are needed to perform operations on different types of data. There are 2 basic types of arithmetic operators:

- **Binary operators** require two operands, such as `x + y` or `a * b`
- **Unary operators** require only one operand, such as `-x` or `+x`

## Binary arithmetic operators

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Remainder `%`
- Exponentiation `**`

## Unary arithmetic operators

- The unary plus operator indicates a positive value. It's an optional operator if you only work with numbers
  - e.g. `console.log(+7)`
- The unary minus operator makes a value or an expression negative
  - e.g. `console.log(-(100 + 5))`
