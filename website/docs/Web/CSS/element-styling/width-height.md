CSS has properties that allow you to set web page elements to a certain width and height. With their help, you can set fixed sizes of elements, whether it is a sidebar, an image, a table, or any other block.

## Width

The width of the block elements can be set with the `width` property. The `min-width` property if set, will set the width of the item to no less than the selected size. The `max-width` property will set the maximum width for an element.

## Height

To set the height value of the blocks, the `height` property is used. Like with the width properties, `min-height` and `max-height` can be used to set the minimum and maximum values for an elements height.
