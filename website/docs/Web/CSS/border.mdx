CSS provides several properties that allow you to define style, width and color of the element border. Setting the borders can be useful as a decoration, and can perform more practical functions, such as highlighting important or interactive elements on a web page.

## Border style

To change the style of the border, the `border-style` property is used. Possible types are for instance: dotted, dashed, solid, etc.

## Border color

The color of the border can be set with the `border-color` property. If it is not specified, the border color will be the text color of the element.

## Border width

The border width is defined with the `border-width` property and any length unit in CSS.

## The `border` property

To set the style for the border, it is not necessary to use all three of the above properties in turn. Instead the `border` property can be used to set everything at once:

```css
p {
  border: 2px solid gray;
}
```

## Border for one side of an element

It is also possible to set a border for one side of the element only. There are `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, `border-left` properties for setting the border on the top, right, bottom and left sides of the element respectively.

### Example

```html title=index.html
<p>News</p>
```

```css title=index.css
p {
  border-bottom: 2px solid brown;
  border-left: 2px solid brown;
}
```

#### Result:

<p style={{ borderBottom: "2px solid brown", borderLeft: "2px solid brown" }}>
  News
</p>
