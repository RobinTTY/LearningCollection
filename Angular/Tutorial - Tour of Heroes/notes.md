# Angular Tutorial: Tour of Heroes

## Scope of this tutorial

- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data
- Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks
- Enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view
- Format data with pipes
- Create a shared service to assemble the heroes
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components

## The Application Shell

You develop apps in the context of an __Angular workspace__. A workspace contains the files for __one or more projects__. A project is the set of files that comprise an app, a library, or end-to-end (e2e) tests.

To create a new workspace and an initial app project run the following command:

```cli
ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
```

### What does this command do

- Structure: ng **new** \<name> [options]
- Creates and initializes a new Angular app that is the default project for a new workspace.
- Provides interactive prompts for optional configuration, such as adding routing support. All prompts can safely be allowed to default.
